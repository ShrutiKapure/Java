An abstract class can have constructors like the regular class.
And, we can access the constructor of an abstract class from the subclass using the super keyword. For example,

abstract class Animal {
   Animal() {
      â€¦.
   }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
   Dog() {
      super();
      ...
   }
}
Here, we have used the super() inside the constructor of Dog to access the constructor of the Animal.
Note that the super should always be the first statement of the subclass constructor.
